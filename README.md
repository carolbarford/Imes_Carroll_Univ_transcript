I picked up the sealed letter from Carroll University from the Imes Family mailbox today, brought it home and photographed both sides of the envelope. Then I opened the envelope and photographed or scanned all the contents. Both the letter from the registrar and the final page of the transcript are embossed and signed by the registrar.
